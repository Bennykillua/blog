Garbage in, garbage out. A phrase conveys that incorrect or poor data quality will produce faulty output. ETL is necessary for this reason.

ETL means Extract, Transform, and Load. These three steps are the foundation of any data analytics and machine learning project, especially if you want promising findings. And I bet you do. The ETL process is also a form of a data pipeline, especially when integrating data from various data sources.

Microsoft Excel and Power BI have an ETL tool and many more tools in them. However, today we are focusing on this ETL tool: Power Query.

## What is ETL?

ETL is an acronym for extract, transform, and load.

- Extract: Data is extracted from legacy applications and various data sources.

- Transform: Data is cleaned and transformed into a more useable form. Duplicates are removed, new columns are formed or split, and much more transformation happens.

- Load: The data is loaded into the target database or analytic software.
